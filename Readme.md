This is a tutorial on how to use the code
-> I don't approve of hosting the bot on replit. it will be buggy and won't be 24/7
use a vps

lets get started.....
No.1 -> Go to discord.dev for making a application aka bot
Make sure to enable the intents or bugs and errors might happen. intents are very important for a bot

No.2 -> Go to config.js
There we will edit according to our server likes and configure the bot
This can be done many times. make sure to be very careful s you don't remove any thing like brackets.

Now let's fill it.
no.3 -> When putting token **DONT PUT IT IN CONFIG.JS PUT IT IN ENV (SHOULD BE token NOT TOKEN OR Token)
that's it. now for emojis to work make sure to invite the bot to our emoji portal.

it is now connected to bot and running 
now invite the bot
